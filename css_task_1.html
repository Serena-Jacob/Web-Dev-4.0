            <h2>Early life and education</h2>
            <p>Arun Rupesh Maini was born on 24 October 1995 in Nottingham, England and is of Indian origin. His
                mother is from India, and moved to the UK when she was 15. Arun's father is from Leicester,
                England. As a child, he attended two schools. On weekdays, he would attend a regular English school,
                and, on
                weekends, he would attend a Hindi school, in order to learn Hindi. He was educated at the fee-paying
                Nottingham High
                School, and then moved on to study economics at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>The Mrwhosetheboss channel initially focused on videos about smartphones. However, as the channel gained
                a following,
                Arun extended his video topic to cover other types of technology, and has since also made other
                opinion-related
                technology videos.</p>
